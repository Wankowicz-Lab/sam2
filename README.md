# SAM: latent diffusion model for protein structural ensemble generation

## About
Repository implementing [aSAM](https://todo.com) (atomistic Structural Autoencoder Model) in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). aSAM is a latent [diffusion model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model) for generating heavy atom conformations of proteins. The model was trained on datasets of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations from [mdCATH](https://github.com/compsciencelab/mdCATH) or [ATLAS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37986215/). Here we provide code for aSAM and weights of two models trained on these two datasets.

This repository mainly implements panel **c** in the figure below, the inference phase of aSAM. Given an input 3D structure provided as a PDB file (and optionally a temperature `T`), you can generate a 3D structural ensemble which should represent an MD ensemble observable in the training dataset of aSAM: 100 ns x 3 runs or 500 ns x 5 runs for ALTAS and mdCATH, respectively.

# 1 - Installation

## 1.1 - Local system
We recommend installing this package in a new [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) that you create from the `sam2.yml` file in this repository. If you follow this strategy, use these commands:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/giacomo-janson/sam2.git
   ```
   and go into the root directory of the repository.
2. Install the dedicated conda environment and dependencies:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f sam2.yml
   ```
3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate sam2
   ```
4. Install the `sam` Python library in editable mode (it will just put the library in [$PYTHONPATH](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH)):
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

# 2 - Usage: generate conformational ensembles

## 2.1 - Running locally

### 2.1.1 - mdCATH-based aSAMt
You can generate a structural ensemble of a custom peptide sequence via the  `scripts/generate_ensemble.py` inference script. To run the mdCATH-based aSAMt model, the usage is:
```bash
python scripts/generate_ensemble.py -c config/mdcath_model.yaml -i examples/input/4qbuA03.320.pdb -o protein -n 250 -b 8 -T 320 -d cuda
```
Here is a description of the arguments:
* `-c`: configuration file for aSAMt. Use the default ones provided in the `config` directory of the repository.
* `-i`: initial PDB file. This represent the initial
* `-o`: output path. In this example, the command will save a series of output files named `protein.*`. These are a DCD trajectory file storing the conformations you generated and a PDB file that you can use as topologies for parsing the DCD file.
* `-n`: number of conformations to generate.
* `-b`: batch size used sampling.
* `-T`: simulation temperature (in units of Kelvin) at which to generate an ensemble.
* `-d`: PyTorch device for the aSAMt models. If you want to generate ensembles with large number of conformations, we recommend to use GPU support, via the `cuda` value here.

There are also other options that you can tweak. Use the `--help` flag to get the full list.

### 2.1.2 - ATLAS-based aSAMc
In case you want to use the ATLAS-based aSAM model, the command is:
```bash
python scripts/generate_ensemble.py -c config/atlas_model.yaml -i examples/input/6h49_A.pdb -o protein -n 250 -b 8 -d cuda
```

Note that this model is not conditioned on temperature, therefore any temperature input will be ignored.

### 2.1.3 - Automatic download of aSAM weights
The first time you will use the `scripts/generate_ensemble.py` script, it will automatically download aSAM weights from a [GitHub release](https://todo.com). The files are pretty large (~ 1 GB for the ATLAS and mdCATH models each), so make sure to have enough storage space. By default, the files will be placed in the `$HOME/.sam2/weights` directory, which will be automatically created. If you want to change their download location, change the `SAM_WEIGHTS_PATH` environmental variable before running the script.

## 2.2 - Notes on aSAM input
üìù **Input PDB structure**: The only required input of this aSAM version is a PDB file. You can provide only PDB files with the following characteristics:
* Single chain PDB file.
* Single model PDB file (e.g.: no multi-model NMR input).
* No missing heavy atoms (e.g.: no missing residues, chain breaks).
* Only atoms from standard amino acid (e.g.: no nucleic acid, ligands or modified residues).

üìù **Temperature range**: The training set temperatures of the mdCATH-based aSAMt range from 320 to 450 K. We tested the model from temperatures from 250 to 710 K. Using temperatures outside this range might produce bad results.

# 3 - Other content
## 3.1 - Machine learning dataset splits
The training/validation/test splits that we used for the ATLAS and mdCATH datasets are available in `data/splits`.
## 3.2 - Input PDB files for systems analyzed in the aSAM article
The input PDB files for all the systems analyzed in the aSAM article are available at: `data/input`.

# 4 - Integrated open-source code
The decoder of aSAM relies on the Structure Module of [AlphaFold2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34265844/). We used the [OpenFold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold) implementation of this module with minor modifications. OpenFold is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. The `sam/openfold` directory is a direct copy from the OpenFold repository, with some small edits.

## 5.1 - Legacy: idpSAM model for intrinsically disordered peptides
If you are looking for idpSAM, a predecessor of aSAM trained on C alpha atoms of implicit solvent simulations of intrinsically disordered peptides, please refer to the [idpSAM](https://github.com/giacomo-janson/idpsam) repository.
